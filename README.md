# ReadME.Md for IoT Cohort 16 Midterm 1 project. 
Utlize Midterm_working Src to run code
## What the project does
The project allows user to manipulate their smart environments, to include smart Hue lights and smart wemo power adaptors.  The wrist mounted design allows for users to have ease of control while having their hands available.  

## Why is the project is useful
Able to build and navigate through numerous menu screens.  Logical flow and easy user interface allows individual devices to be set and customized.  

## How users can get started with the project
To assemble the device, connect breadboard to body of gauntlet case.  There is a recessed space to the breadboard can align in the correct assembly.  Plug in the Photon 2 utilizing the 10foot USB-A cable for added range.  Once plugged in, slide the body of the gauntlet into the chosen arm sleeve.  Slide forearm into the arm sleeve, utilize smooth and skillful movements to alight arm, breadboard and gauntlet in chosen forearm location.  Wait for photo 2 to initialize, read OLED to obtain status.  Once connected to the network, connect faceplate to gauntlet arms and control your smart devices. 
## Menu Navigation
Once Menu has initialized and opened onto Manual or Automatic screen, use the encoder to navigate through the menus.  Use the button on the encoder to select an option and manipulate the smart devices based on user input via the manual screen.  Or select Automatic and select a few preprogramed options to impress your classmates.
